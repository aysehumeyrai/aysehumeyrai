# 🧠 Learning and Practice Projects

Welcome! This repository is a personal lab for my own learning, experimenting, and practicing skills in:

- 📊 **Data Analysis** (Python, Excel, SQL)
- 🤖 **Artificial Intelligence & Robotics**
- 💻 **Programming** (Python, Java)
- 🛠️ **Miscellaneous mini-projects and exercises**

## 📌 Purpose

This repo is mainly for:
- Practicing and reinforcing coding and data skills
- Sharing progress with others
- Building a portfolio of small but meaningful work

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This is a living repository — updates will be made regularly as I explore and learn more topics.


## 📂 My Projects

- 📊 Data Analysis Practice – Pandas and Python exploration.
- 🤖 AI & Robotics – Went some courses and a lot more on the way!
